# web_server_made_rusty
A multi-threaded TCP/HTTP server built in Rust, following the implementation patterns from The Rust Programming Language (Chapter 20).

## Motivation
I am an Aerospace Engineer, and Embedded Software developer.  
While I am comfortable with real-time constraints, memory-mapped I/O, and hardware protocols like SPI/I2C, I knew nothing about Computer next works.

This project serves as way to learn a little about computer networks, while also practing my rust Programming skills :).
